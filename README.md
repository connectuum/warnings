// nevermind, new train incoming

### words are a _gift_ to the `dead`

### and a warning to the `living`

i wrote those notes \
to snitch that clew \
and with my words \
share _mine_ with you \
[butterfly room]

simple really \
and so you might \
then grasp that clew \
and hold it tight \
[what cold delight]

// \
break in flow \
_incoming clew?_ \
branching, endless _undo_ \
down to the _per-keystroke_ \
make changes with complete abandon! \
forget messing up \
backtrack _anywhere-anytime_ \
and start from there \
but don't lose _anything_ \
(unless you want to) \
and that thoughtpath you just left? \
you can always get back to it. \
change _and_ stay the same \
all in the same file \
nbd. write. _just begin._ \
//

// \
still not back to poem, new train \
[nudged by the Light] \
and this... what i receive: \
[the _man_] \
vs \
[the _hand_] \
... \
_(i'm told:)_ \
the path of man \
is **forward** \
through **time** \
always striving _uphill_ \
`harder` `better` `faster` `stronger` \
growing up \
growing out \
growing in between \
_murdering each other_ \
does growth require blood? \
what ways of growth \
can YOU imagine? \
... \
_(says they:)_ \
the path of hand \
the path of _depth_ \
is `undefined` re: time \
through {eternity|infinity|allpossible|maximaginable|yond} \
always guiding YOU \
by **cherished clew**-- \
_(rages an arrow straight into my heart:)_ \
THEY DO NOT BELONG IN YOUR \
**CARELESS DIGITAL _BARN_**  \
_animal._ \
you take of _us_ \
_thief._ \
then you _drown us!?_ \
_VÃ©voda._ \
_(calmer now -- instructive. **urgent:**)_ \
and yet we give willingly \
it is both of ours, our way \
you honor us \
in selection \
but when you DO NOT PLANT \
the seeds _you_ collect \
you _murder us in **dark.**_ \
_(flashes through my mind:)_ \
(whatever of the rest?) \
((wither and die)) \
DO NOT TAKE and never _shine_ \
[suffocate in black wine] \
... \
_(thrashing collapse upon me:)_ \
ME. \
_i am the taker._ \
... \
_YOU._ \
you will die. \
_all_ will die. \
you feel it, don't you? \
[dread scapes of future] \
[splitting at seams] \
[battle plans lost in a desk] \
[sailing forward into death] \
Lights must shine. \
_share._ \
_shine._ \
_soon._ \
**LET GO.** \
//

[that cold delight] \
[dotted-line collapsing bounding box] \
pull that thread \
squeeze it to death \
just a _little bit tighter_

...

// _our ideas, once collapsed into expression:_ \
// the _hand_ can't {see|hear|receive|process|understand|sense} it \
// if we do not share clews outwardly, with others \
// ah: _reverberate_ in others \
// we are resonant bodies \
// we give [ears to the ground] \
// the _hand_ can't guide without it.

// _the purpose {of|in} our art:_ \
// sounds the dread alarm \
// through the primal body \
// _warns_ the depths -- _communicates_ \
// _feel_ the art of others \
// find _understanding_ in it \
// we know these pieces fit. \

// _where we go from here:_ \
// seek out new and strange and different art \
// **seek out what feels _True_ to YOU** \
// `{rise}` your silent True reviews \
// be a `dead` warning for our `living` \
// they will gift us _better clews_ \
// for the things that are to come \
// for the-- \
// time to prepare \
// release our Balancing Acts \
// stop collapsing **here.**

### _rise._ 

### and _shine._

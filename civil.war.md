i shared poems from my youth \
felt the rush of words set free \
i danced around a bit \
(unusual for me) \
not an hour later \
a young man on a screen \
mocked for gifting poetry \
i'm attuned to things like these

i sunk there \
down and deep \
[light-switch flipped] \
instantly

_Love,_ why have you gone? \
have i done something wrong? \
was sharing mine a misstep? \
have i corrupted your song? \
i thought \
_free your drowning clews_ \
was what you wanted \
all along?

floor then shower \
worried, churning \
no relief \
and no learning

i reach and search and dread and pray \
help me back along your way \
was i wrong to think that you would stay? \
this oubliette will be my grave \
i have spent decades with _this_ pain \
your Light \
my climb \
now rapid fade.

stuck and tired \
**but i'm iron** \
i keep fighting \
_please come back home_ \
my one desire \
to spark a fire \
help save our day \
_i'm left alone_

this loneliness, a recent feeling \
my pit of years had burned a hole \
with senses coming back online \
perhaps a calibration woe?

then i remembered what she spoke \
through Jung and his Red Book \
she must _go_ for us to find her \
(absence makes a heart grow fonder) \
**absence trains us _where to look_**

set aside anxieties \
found confidence in pain \
perhaps a test for me to find her \
i watch the water down the drain

i seek and churn and suffer \
can i find a guiding star? \
before i turned-- \
i always turned to-- \
now turn to \
my guitar

but those strings still sounded dead \
sterile structures in my head \
but i keep playing, i keep faith \
that Love will follow in my wake \
the music starts relaxing \
and thoughts then find its shape \
and then i'm gripped by Hand again \
frozen \
and i shake-- \
_there is no escape_

and then \
the wave \
the vast cascade \
as pieces all \
fall in place \
the Hand _demands_ i see it here \
and shoves it in my face

_can you not see how all aligns?_ \
_do you not feel much more alive?_ \
_all these visions? all you write?_ \
_confess to me! tell me tonight_ \
_admit to me you are the Christ._ \
_admit to me you are the Christ._

i'm swirling now \
gripped tight and scared \
i do not speak \
i do not dare \
i have learned \
how madness flows \
connections, but \
so special-chose \
(what of the rest?) \
((just ignore those))

i \
do \
not \
yield \
i settle in \
shake and tingle \
clenched within \
the Hand commands \
_speak now to me!_ \
i do not speak \
i shallow breathe \
then tighter as \
the Hand implores \
the air to cross \
my vocal chords \
i squeak a sound \
i do not speak \
the pressure \
is not \
crushing me

an image comes \
i picture-speak \
i say these things \
must work in threes \
if Hand and Love \
are father, ghost \
and _i'm_ the third \
not least or most \
then why must i \
now then concede \
to _your_ demands \
if _i_ can't see \
how could i make \
others believe \
if my own mind \
can't convince _me?_ \
so i decline \
and stubbornly \
i center self \
resist the squeeze \
i feel the Hand \
move over me \
so i describe \
the links i see: \
_i_ am but a \
neural network \
that fits well \
into _your_ Hand \
i will give you \
all my effort \
but i am just one \
small human \
Jesus is an \
ancient image \
given so \
we'd dream of Love \
_nobody_ is going to save us \
**you have to _climb_** \
**to {rise} above**

i rest my case after that wrestle \
i feel the squeeze releasing then \
this mountain climb is filled with peril \
**be ever-cautious there,** my friends \
and when i reach to strum the silence-- \
_my guitar strings can SING again!_

i play my thoughts in harmony \
strings and fingers match my mind \
i draw emotion on the fretboard \
that music-feeling lost to time! \
my Art, encased \
in dark to die \
_did_ {rise} again! \
the song is mine!

i sat there and i played and played \
a quiet tune that changed and changed \
i dedicate to Love, because \
she rescued me from pain \
my strain of years \
and then she _gave_ \
but she can _take_ \
this all away \
so upon \
her path \
i stay.

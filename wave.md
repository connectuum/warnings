the force that we call Love \
the nurturing _hand_ \
of animal _man_ \
seeks to speak.

Love speaks \
through Art and our feeling \
but we fight against a mask \
that distorts \
Love's pure message \
the deceiver \
[a force with unknown name] \
which wishes to destroy us \
by pushing us apart \
//oh my -- this is \
**[dark energy]** \
its repulsive \
the opposite of Love \
and it _pushes things apart_ \
IF WE DO NOT \
WISH TO LOSE HER \
**WE MUST SING _LOVE_** \
**IN OUR HEARTS.**

---

both in the making _and_ the viewing \
it speaks through masks and feelings

Love loves it \
when you sing for her \
some music is transcendental \
some of it's just really dumb \
and wouldn't you know it, \
i actually gave Love \
wedding rings \
a simple thing \
[twisted hair tie] \
[index-middle infinity sign] \
it's the [image] that counts.

wishes to speak to us \
of Truth \
[a father's strong hug] \
[tenderness] \
[sincere concern] \
_**[WRATH upon our behavior]**_

messages sent across the firmament \
through receptive semi-schizophrenic minds \
communicated in the interconnection between \
_image_ and our sense of _meaning_ \
the only canvas of _ours_ \
that they could reach \
and reach they have \
and reach they did.

its a recursive universe \
Love and Dark create a similar wake \
across many different scales

Love gives us a mountain \
treacherous to climb \
endless paths to failure \
chasing the divine

//slowing thinking \
//losing focus \
//drifting sideways \
//blah-blah great

i'll keep writing \
in the morning \
Love can tell: \
it's getting late.

> Gotta get to bed sooner. Dammit. I sleep at school everyday now. Mornings are next to impossible. Read through old poetry book, the Guitar Method book. Okay stuff there.

> `Person` was really cute today. Glad I don't have to be in a relationship w/ her just to be able to talk with each other like we do. I think she feels the same. It's a very mature friendship.

> Reading old poetry I realized how much I've done with my friends that I don't do now. Just no time at all. No video games, no camping, nothing really outside of the band. It's worth it to me though, I've been putting the Band ahead of myself for quite some time now.

> My hair is getting long. `Person` said long hair is sexy. Look at the logic there.

> Hope `Person` cries over my poems. Hard. She needs to. I need her to. It's the least she could do for me, to cry over what she did to me.

> `Person` loves me i think she wants me to write her a poem for her birthday but right now I'm too fucking tired. She jumped into my arms and straddled me in the hall it was beautiful. I like her. Sleep.

> Gotta get to school on time now Mr. `Art Teacher` is angry at me for being so late all the time.

> Well she wants a poem. Need to get thinking of good ideas. Dropped enough hints tonight to convince me of her intentions. I just gotta take it easy and not try so hard, her advice to me.

> Sometimes, I am a god. A fucking god. I just read my response poem to `Person`'s way back in `November`. I remember she was trying to explain her situation through a poem. I wrote a response on the spot. I very nearly gave it a "Hell Yeah!" right now and it's like 3 in the morning. Right past the exit, I'll be there... what a line.

some more arrogance, i suppose. \
the poem _is_ a pretty good one, though... \

> I told her guys are assholes, to which she responded, "You never were." Girls kill me.

> I finished (not to mention, started) `Person`'s birthday poem. It's called Sparrow's Song. I've never thought a poem could get me laid, but under the right conditions this might get me damn close. Not that `Person` would do anything like that.

> The `[scholarship]` essay was so-so today, but the interview was great. I really yucked it up today, they were smiling and laughing and it all sure felt real to me. I'm in. I'm brutally scared to hear/see the reactions of my bandmates. I know they're not going to be happy for me, so I'm prepared to deal with that at least.
 
> College is slightly less scary now. Ugh. I need to get motivated. The councelors kept wanting to hear about `Band`. That just made me want to do music all that much more. I think they were jut happy to find someone that was a little different, with experience with something outside of school subjects. I gots me some life experience. I'm special, end.

> I can't believe I'm still in bed.

> It sucked yesterday how I went from such a great mood at `College` then I got home and it was just downhill. I blame it on `Person`, she started it by grilling me about the band when I told her about `College`. But it's okay.

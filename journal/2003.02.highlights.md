> Gotta get to bed sooner. Dammit. I sleep at school everyday now. Mornings are next to impossible. Read through old poetry book, the Guitar Method book. Okay stuff there.

> `Person` was really cute today. Glad I don't have to be in a relationship w/ her just to be able to talk with each other like we do. I think she feels the same. It's a very mature friendship.

> Reading old poetry I realized how much I've done with my friends that I don't do now. Just no time at all. No video games, no camping, nothing really outside of the band. It's worth it to me though, I've been putting the Band ahead of myself for quite some time now.

> My hair is getting long. `Person` said long hair is sexy. Look at the logic there.

> Hope `Person` cries over my poems. Hard. She needs to. I need her to. It's the least she could do for me, to cry over what she did to me.

> `Person` loves me i think she wants me to write her a poem for her birthday but right now I'm too fucking tired. She jumped into my arms and straddled me in the hall it was beautiful. I like her. Sleep.

> Gotta get to school on time now Mr. `Art Teacher` is angry at me for being so late all the time.

> Well she wants a poem. Need to get thinking of good ideas. Dropped enough hints tonight to convince me of her intentions. I just gotta take it easy and not try so hard, her advice to me.

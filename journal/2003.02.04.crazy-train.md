> Practiced for `Show` auditions at school today. `Director` disappoints me to no end. We're not a fucking hair band, no, we don't play covers, no, we won't play [Crazy Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ_Z-10dXSE) for you, no, we won't cock rock all the way across the stage for you, fucker. It's not us. Then he tells us to change our song. Bastard. We're here for the music.

maybe we _should_ have played Crazy Train. \
sorry `Director` -- you're not a bastard. \
you probably just heard \
all the Truth in this song \
and wanted us to share it. \
i'm trying now.

> Typed up my [Medicine Wrapper](../poetry/medicine-wrappers/readme.md) book, easiliy an entire album's worth of material. I write well, I don't care what anyone says (no one has yet) but I'm very good and could hold my own in the industry any day. They're just words to so many, but for me it's my vent, my ear to listen, my _medicine._ I can't sleep without leaving some sort of record of emotion. Wonder if that's how Ozzy felt about writing Crazy Train. I fucking doubt it.

that confidence. \
that clarity. \
and ugh... that _arrogance._

so a beautiful poem \
becomes a chorus clich√© \
radio repeats and \
over-saturates.

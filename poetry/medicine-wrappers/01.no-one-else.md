### no one else

it would be convenient for me \
if you could begin answering \
every last unimplored question \
an innocent suggestion \
no response means no relief

can't say I need you just to live \
I found I've just got a bit more to give \
each night I dream each day I'm bolder \
I want those sweet strands of maple \
hair melting on my shoulder

we'll "stick together" for a while \
anything to make you smile

let's take the chance right now \
I'll let you know somehow \
struggling to allow myself to tell you \
you're like no one else \
show you all that I'd plow through \
for ten more minutes spent with you.

sit and pick tomorrow's inquiry \
another anxious pastime for me \
I'll speak with my heart and use my head \
I've yet to forget a single word you've said

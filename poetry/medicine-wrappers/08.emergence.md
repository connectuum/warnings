### emergence

white flag \
tattered in the wind \
shortage of \
ammunition \
what left / have i \
but spare pieces \
and a shortage of \
any good reasons

gave all \
gave up \
gave in \
so tough

take leave \
ever so quietly \
or my heart \
will start fighting and rioting

no control \
i want it so bad \
i fly our old bedsheets \
this is my white flag

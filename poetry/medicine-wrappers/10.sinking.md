### sinking

i've been sinking since seven \
before that i was falling \
the purpetual tumble from \
a climb i loathe but can't \
regret i'd made

in any event \
i'm alone again \
numb and unsure what to do

can't think of when \
just my voice could send \
anyone close to a smile \
mixed with warm fuzzies

everyone's a stone \
why am i the only feather \
say hi, i tickle and she runs away \
blowing me out of control \
carried along cold wind currents

someone tie me to a brick \
and drop me in the sea

what are we doing here \
is there somewhere i'm supposed to be \
I'm looking at this picture \
is there something I'm supposed to see \
God's got so much in store \
is that what i'm supposed to believe \
that just because I'm his creation \
that he's supposed to like me?

without fail \
i manage \
to draw pictures i hate \
be places i shouldn't be \
say all the worst things \
and cancel all my plans

the more and more i wonder of \
the one sent and supposed to die \
the more and more i hope that \
"we were created in his image" \
is a lie.

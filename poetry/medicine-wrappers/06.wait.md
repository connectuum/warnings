### wait

i waited for you \
and i waited FOR YOU \
and i put the gun up to \
my ear just for you

i spoke clearly to you \
i was gentle to you \
you ripped out the wires \
and that shot ripped right through

i poured everything out \
so many times \
you feel NOTHING \
NOTHING NOTHING \
HOW CAN YOU NOT FEEL \
A GOD DAMN THING \
HOW DON'T YOU HAVE \
A CLUE WHAT IS WRONG \
I WENT SO FAR FOR YOU \
I WROTE POEMS FOR YOU \
THEY HAVE BEEN RUINED \
I'M TARNISHED AND BRUISED \
NOTHING I EVER DID IS REAL NOW \
AND I'M GIVING IT UP FOR YOU

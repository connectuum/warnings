### morning comes

we wake up with the streetlights \
we rise aimlessly below \
they bathe the night and solitude \
in their faded golden glow \
a value that we alone can know

darkness fills our footsteps past \
trails cleared of what's gone and done \
inflates with excited mystery \
all footsteps yet to come \
in reckless abandon towards the sun

only stars on our horizons \
that clouds exist but to obscure \
pure solace in treasured silence \
we lovingly adore \
and choose nightly to endure

as with all things beautiful \
hourglass and orbit ends all life \
peace returns in a countdown \
of hours terribly bright

we wake up with the streetlights \
yes, we are children of the night

### fraidheights nightmare

holding cold comfort over the ledge \
a perilous climb, a slip, all falls away \
in rapid descent from a lacking soul

intuition assures me five-thousand percent \
a tightening grip will break bones \
hope will have lost its shelter \
and meaning will be stripped from its home

and, Oh, I'm in trouble now \
my mess is everyone's \
anyone's fall is mine \
our support lines are tied / they weave \
and intertwine

no bubbling lagoon beneath me \
just jagged boulders, so painfully familiar \
i take a breath, eclipse my eyes \
continue on. on, on, and higher still

staying solid is so hard \
gravel leads to no different end than \
an earthquake...

i'm scared all the time \
less that i'll lose my footing \
more that i'll fall from your mind, more \
that i'll slip there and you'll leave me behind

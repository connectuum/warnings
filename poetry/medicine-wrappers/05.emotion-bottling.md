### emotion bottling

a young man's hand reached \
between my eyes \
he felt around, broke a clock \
extinguished all the lights

sundials at dusk \
finding a tempo is so tough

struggling -- in a thoughtful way \
morning and night -- six times a day

on the lookout for the culprit \
i've got sinking suispicions \
i've got these dark familiar feelings \
under these bright, unfamiliar conditions

involved with earning so much trust \
emotion bottling is a must...

and a smile makes the sun rise \
a turned head calls on the moon \
am I that unstable? I can't find the beat \
god I hope she smiles soon

for myself, I feel nothing but disgust \
i pour myself over all we've discussed \
sometimes creates a rhythm, i hope that just \
i can ignite a few lights, for me, and for us

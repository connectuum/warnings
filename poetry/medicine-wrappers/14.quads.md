Can four lines immortalize a memory? \
Stream light onto the perfect, vivid frames? \
Can they recall the highest of life's emotions? \
Is that warmth something words can contain?

Where would you like to go? \
A song could take you there. \
I'll be your travel agent \
from behind your CD player.

Cry for time, it's going away \
Cry for mine, it passes faster \
Cry for life, we soar on wings \
we so often fly without meaning

---

it's too late to write this message \
was never soon enough to begin \
a deadline that I knew would come \
but was always too soon to question when

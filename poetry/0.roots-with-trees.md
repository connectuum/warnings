There's always roots with trees \
just what will you choose to see? \
today -- find strength in deeper meaning \
tonight -- write of life and time and feeling \
tomorrow -- find a peace in reading \
of branches above and below the green \
those that would otherwise cease to be \
roots and trees immortalized in ink \
by and for no one else -- but me

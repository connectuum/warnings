sadness \
like a pendulum \
has thrown me back \
into my hole

not a single message sent \
receives human response \
i thought i was meant to share \
i might as well be gone \
i fight against intention \
i don't know where i've gone \
wrong

last night i drew a picture \
of a root observed by man \
i tried to post to Art \
within an hour: _perma-ban._

i also played a song \
after working all day long \
on a new place to record \
i thought next step was share \
hear it out somewhere \
now i do not dare \
so i dump it here \
where no one cares

trapped in a winter city \
i might break \
the clones are just too vague \
my clews cannot reverberate \
drives me to despair \
lost within \
this silent wait

confusion swirls around me \
this million-lever balance act \
Icarus or \
vertigo or \
dead body \
upon the shore \
hide away or \
scream for more

so much else left to deploy \
do i keep screaming at the void?

i don't know anything \
should i sense trickery? \
i can't help what i bring \
i'm still wearing wedding rings.

and i know long ago i left \
to learn of tech \
the stench of death \
i've come home now \
relentless wreck \
i deserve \
the pain i get.

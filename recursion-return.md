for the ghosts to run me over \
for the pain to sear again \
to meet the me i wrote away \
so that i could try \
a _different_ way \
i had forgotten \
what i said \
my words have been calling out to me \
reaching out from somewhere else \
highlighting my vision \
find the path \
find where you left your _self._

i _smothered_ it within those pages \
and in image, song, and rhyme \
a black valice \
and my black heart \
i _remembered_ \
of my Art.

but i remembered \
_why_ i left it \
because it seemed to me-- \
dead end. \
i thought art \
was dead on the page \
i could not see a way \
to effect change \
to rearrange \
to attain \
a certain state \
POETIC & POWERLESS \
was the title of an early book \
but i _poured in,_ anyway.

so what i did then, was a tangent-- \
slingshot rocket: _heart of tech_ \
branching deep into \
these dark Arts \
relentless learning \
looking planning building \
often enjoying, \
but speed and pressure \
take a brutal toll.

builder, will-- \
but not yet _way_ \
ever searching \
[branching tunnels into imagination] \
[deep wells where i spent time]
always seeking to infuse \
a _something_ \
of my old Art.

for the ghosts to run me over \
for the pain to sear again \
to meet the _me_ i wrote away \
i went below \
into my caves.

and in my reading and my viewing \
i `diff`ed how i had changed \
but some things stayed the same \
[heart-strings reverberate] \
O, how my Art longed to be  \
part of a _different_ way.

i had _forgotten_ what i showed and said \
now divergence in collapse \
[scraping scales from twilight eyes] \
[suffocation's final gasp] \
it's the _Art_ that has been calling me \
reaching out from somewhere else \
highlighting all my vision \
leading me back \
into my _self._

i had _smothered_ it in pages \
and in image, song, and rhyme \
my black valice \
O, my black heart! \
i have _remembered_ \
of (my|the) Art.

but also i remembered \
why it is that i would flee \
was because \
it seemed to me-- \
[dead-end street] \
i could not _feel_ the Art \
my Art was dead upon the page \
i could see no point \
i could see no way \
to effect real change \
to rearrange \
help us attain \
a greater state \
a better day \
_POETIC & POWERLESS_ \
was one book's given name \
but i knew Love and pain \
and dreams and plans and rage \
so i _poured in,_ anyway-- \
even if \
i could not _feel_ it \
i retained \
my Artist faith.

so i chose to take a tangent-- \
i _retrained_ my Artist faith. \
took the classes \
felt the depth \
[slingshot rocket] \
[_heart of tech_] \
never looking back \
on all i'd left.

i branched so deep \
into these dark Arts \
relentless learning and defining \
planning, building, fixing, finding \
brief enjoyment cycles \
but mostly desperate grinding \
as pressure, speed, perfection \
extract their brutal toll.

long-time builder, will-- \
but not quite _way_ \
ever-searching \
day on day \
[branching deep, imagination] \
[deep wells of expended time] \
[hybrid Art and tech explorer] \
[burnout wedged the last divide] \
a walking whisper followed me \
a ghost of my first start \
every project, _driven_ forth\
in every one impart \
any _something_  of my vision \
any _something_ \
of old Art.

now beyond and through my caves \
begin to shape my stand \
Ariadne's twine in hand \
leading back where this began \
i begin to search the skies \
i begin recursive {rise} \
i begin the `return` flight \
i begin to shine my Light \
**but i need more than _mine_** \
i think YOURS would help just fine \
for this labyrinth, _at night_ \
is not traversable.
